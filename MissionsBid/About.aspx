        About
        Missions bid</h2>
    <p>
        MissionsBid (MB) is an organization designed for online sellers to list their 
        products for online shoppers to support a charity or project of their choice. An 
        added benefit is the donors of products sold will receive a tax-exempt receipt 
        for their participation and support of these organizations. The foundational 
        element that makes MB different is its offering of financial support to smaller 
        projects than any of its competitors. Instead of proceeds from sales only going 
        to large organizations such as World Vision or Samaritan’s Purse, the proceeds 
        can be sent to fund a youth group’s short-term missions trip. Interested 
        partners can contact MB, for example, to create a partnership. MB will accept a 
        partner based on whether the partner meets MB’s criteria of a faith-based 
        organization.</p>
